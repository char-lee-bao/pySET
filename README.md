# PySET
pySET is a Python implementation of the SET card game

## Description 
SET is a card game based on pattern recognition. The game consist of 81 unique cards that have 3 variations of 4 different properties:
* Number of shapes (one, two, or three)
* Shapes (diamonds, squiggles, or ovals)
* Shading (solid, striped, or open)
* Color (red, green, or purple)
The goal of the game focuses on identifying SETs. A combination of three cards are defined to be a SET for which in each of the four properties, the three cards must either be all the same or all different for that property.

Click three cards to identify a SET. Click the Give Hint button to highlight cards that are a SET if one is on board.
